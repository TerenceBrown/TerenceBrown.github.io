<p>Operate powered industrial trucks to load and unload materials and deliveries and move them to and from storage areas, machines and loading docks, into railroad cars or trucks or storage facilities. The two forks on the front of the truck slide underneath palletised loads, to lift and transport safely. Because rough terrain vertical mast forklifts are larger and made to handle heavier loads than vertical mast counterbalanced forklifts (classes 1, 4 and 5), they require more space to operate as well as a sturdy surface that offers substantial support. Call Andy Putnam, Rental Manager (315) 413-4150 or use the Rentals Request form to send us a Quick Request.</p>
<p>Completing your training and receiving your certification will only enable you to drive that specific forklift truck â€” any additional trucks will require you to take an entirely new course.

We also rent manual pallet jacks, electric carts, scissor lifts, ramps, and various forklift attachments such as rotators, clamps, carpet poles, and extensions.</p>

<p>Pallet trucks should be durable, not disposable. More custom shops are toying around with lengthened trucks on custom chassis or even military truck chassis to create one-of-a-kind builds that get rubber-necked more than a 10-car pileup. Therefore, a fork lift operator must be able to use the machine to fit large, heavy pallets into relatively small areas, such as large shelving fixtures.</p>

<p>Unused pallet jacks are a major trip hazard. Electric forklifts are battery-powered and will generally last through one standard shift before needing to be recharged. Even if you've never walked into a warehouse or never even seen a forklift or order picker, our training caters to all types of skill levels. Ask your Raymond Handling Concepts Sales Rep about new, used or rental availability of lift trucks and other materials handling equipment.</p>
<p>The 30 Wastemaster counterbalance forklift with telescopic boom is a proven cost saver. Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>

If you see yourself going on frequent off-road adventures, a suspension lift will be beneficial. In order to be able to pick up heavy loads at the front, a forklift has to be even heavier at the back. They have over 60 years of experience in equipment rental.</p>
<p>For example, a forklift with a 10,000-pound (4,540 kg) lift capacity is limited to a maximum lift height of 20 feet (6 m) and a maximum forward reach of 8 feet (2 m) when lifting a full 10,000-pound load.

Before installing any attachment contact your local authorized dealer of your forklift brand and ask them to begin re-rating your lift according to the attachment you want to install.</p>
