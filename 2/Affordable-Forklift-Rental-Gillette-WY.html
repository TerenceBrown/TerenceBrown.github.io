Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Sit-down forklifts are also more accessible to a wider pool of forklift operators for that reason. Some of these can also save you on the purchase of unnecessary equipment by converting a rough terrain forklift to a number of other heavy industrial machines. Lift Capacity: 6000 lbs.
