<h2>Lift Systems & Material Handling Grovetown </h2>
<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height.

Like how its name says, the side loader forklift can drive up alongside pallet racks or other industrial shelving and can unload without having to turn.
