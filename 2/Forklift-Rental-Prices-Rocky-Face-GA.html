<p>Leading Manufacturer of hydraulic pallet truck, sewing machine lifter, wrap beam lifter, pallet truck, hand trolley and materiel handling pallet truck from Coimbatore. We have forklift hire & rental available for periods as short as a couple of hours and as long as up to five years. Acclaimed in the industry as a manufacturer and supplier, we are engaged in offering Semi Electric Pallet Truck from our extensive collection of products. By using the know-how gained from years of experience in production of industrial vehicles and the latest technologies, Komatsu markets a variety of lift trucks, including small-to large-sized engine-powered lift trucks, battery-powered lift trucks, and HST-drive lift trucks.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up.

They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
