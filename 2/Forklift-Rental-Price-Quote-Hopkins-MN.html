<h3>The Benefits of Renting Forklifts in and Other Material Handling Equipment Hopkins MN 55343</h3>

Other key features include an intuitive multi-function control handle, patented open view mast, low step height, ductile iron baselegs and an exclusive suspension system for superior load stability.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
