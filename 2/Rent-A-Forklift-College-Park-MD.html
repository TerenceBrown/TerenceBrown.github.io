<h3>Forklift Information College Park MD</h3>
<p>Numerous product options, which provide the necessary load capacity and lifting heights, are also available within the reach truck series. Even if you are just going to operate a forklift one time for a specific job, OSHA requires that in addition to a license, you need to be certified to use a forklift and you also need authorization from your employer. If your company utilizes a very narrow aisle operation this classification of lift trucks is for you.</p>
<p>With over 80 years' experience in the materials handling industry, we've developed a range of robust, efficient and performance enhancing forklift trucks and warehouse equipment; ensuring your applications are completed efficiently, safely and smoothly. Forklift capacities often range from 3,000 - 7,000 lbs, meaning you can load at least 1,600 lbs on your pallet with the order picker.</p>
<p>The second type is a body lift kit, which raises your truck between one and three inches and allows you to keep your standard tires while giving them a wider margin from the body. The reach forklift also features low under-carriage clearance and so we recommend that, prior to purchasing, you survey when the truck would be in operation. The warehouses owned by the companies will be shifting towards mechanization through Pallet trucks and integrate with warehouse management systems to handle complex environments of future.</p>
