<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>

<p>In the case of forklifts, safe practices must be practised such as having an overhead guard that protects the operator from the accidental falling of objects which could happen whilst loading the forklift. Before you select any hydraulic pump, however, there are several important pieces of information to take into consideration that will help you match it with the right hydraulic tool, cylinder, or equipment.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking.
