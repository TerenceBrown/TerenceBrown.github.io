Different forklifts are made for different loading capacity and height of pallet racks. While some lifts, like body lifts, are actually pretty straightforward, a mighty suspension lift can require a lot of extra considerations, parts, and work.</p>

Side Loader forklifts have been popular in the past as they were the first forklift designed specifically for long load handling. Unfortunately for those who want the Rocky Ridge bumpers on their Jeep but don't necessarily care about the rest of the lift kit, they are not available as a separate option.</p>

<p>But, I wouldn't be so quick to diss those who have lifted their trucks for better traction.

Rough terrain forklifts evolved from standard forklifts. Better Equipment: In addition to freeing up capital , leasing a forklift usually results in getting better equipment than you could afford to buy.</p>
