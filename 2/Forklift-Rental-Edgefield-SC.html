<p>Workers need to be trained in proper load management before operating this forklift. Before you can spice up your life with a lifted ride, you likely are in need of some financial help.

Our powered pallet trucks are easy to manoeuvre with load capacities up to 3t, perfect for material handling operations. Operating a rough terrain forklift exposes you to many hazards.</p>
