<p>Gray Manufacturing has produced the highest quality jacks and lifting products for over 60 years. We provide UniCarriers Forklifts including stand up and sit down trucks from 3,000 to 15,500 lb. They have the ability to reach loads that sit up high and can extend to distances beyond their stabilising legs. Compared to a forklift, these machines have a smaller capacity. Drivers should know the capacity of the machine to prevent tipping due to overly heavy or improperly balanced loads.</p>
<p>Standup trucks lift and slide pallets in a simple movement and double deep trucks have extra long forks which are able to be used in two pallet deep shelving systems. New Yale Equipment not sold by Pap√© Material Handling in the following CA counties: San Luis Obispo, Kings, Kern, Tulare, Fresno, Inyo and Madera. A body lift does not increase the clearance by a huge amount, other than by allowing for bigger tires that can help raise the underside.</p>

<p>If you purchased a truck with a lift kit and you're not certain of its lift height, you'll need to measure the difference between the factory ride height (found in your truck's service manual) and its current ride height. In the 1940s, forklifts became even easier to use, thanks to batteries that drivers could recharge. Because of the nature of their work and the environments in which they operate, using rough terrain forklifts can also pose numerous hazards.</p>

In 1962, the first telescoping-boom rough terrain forklift came on the market. Check the areas around and behind your vehicle before putting it in reverse, even if that means you need to temporarily turn the truck off, hop down out of the driver's seat and do a quick check for any children or pedestrians in the area.</p>
<p>There's a wide variety of styles and designs available, some capable of moving loads of 5000lbs, but the main difference is between the lift and pallet trucks. Still, with the right business plan, it can be achieved with a good level of success - forklifts are always in demand in various industries. Most rental companies use Toyota forklift models due to their reputation for safety and performance.</p>
