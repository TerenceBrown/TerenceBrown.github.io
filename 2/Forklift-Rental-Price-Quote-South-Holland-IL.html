Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
<p>That is the principle upon which every detail of the design of these order pickers is based: The low entry height is gentle on the legs when mounting and dismounting, platforms with non-slip mats that are decoupled from the chassis by rubber supports reduce the effect of vibrations, and operation is simple thanks to ergonomically arranged and shaped control panels.</p>

If the loads are too much for the load capacity of the truck, this can cause the lift to tip over.</p>
