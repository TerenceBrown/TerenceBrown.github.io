A reach truck provides a range of features to help you to do the job. Indoor forklifts come with cushion tires to make it easier to maneuver on smooth warehouse floors.</p>
<p>Virtually any standard sized truck can be lifted to a certain extent or another. Some pallet jack models are able to lift loads all the way up to 15,000 pounds (6,803 kg). The forklift and load must be considered a unit with a continually varying center of gravity with every movement of the load. The pallet truck is simply for moving loads from one place to another at ground level, but it has limited reach, while the lift truck is more complex and is capable of transporting and lifting a palletised load onto a higher level or for stacking loads on top of each other.</p>
<p>In most cases a reach forklift operator sits sideways but there are some forklifts which accommodate a standing operator.

Drive and operate your rental equipment safely. Batteries prevent the emission of harmful fumes and are recommended for facilities in which employees are in close proximity to forklifts in operation, food-processing and healthcare sectors.</p>
