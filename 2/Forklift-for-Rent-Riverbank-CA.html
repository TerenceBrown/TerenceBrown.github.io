<p>With greater ground clearance, a counterbalance forklift is certainly the better choice for uneven surface or outside work. Industrial counterbalance lift trucks are deadly - more than one hundred workers die and thousands are injured every year as a result of these powerful machines. Rough-terrain forklifts offer great versatility and are often called to fill a niche application.</p>
<p>It is imperative that you make a good sound and informed decision to ensure that you purchase the right forklift for the job within your desired budget. However, lifting provides many advantages for off-road use, including greater approach, breakover, and departure angles. Counterbalance forklifts have no extending arms, giving them the ability to move directly to the load.</p>
<p>Due to ineffective (or nonexistent) training, many forklift drivers aren't aware of max load capacities, or how to safely navigate their workspace with a heavy load. Our friendly and knowledgable forklift sales staff will do a full site assessment to identify the best new forklift for you. Another place where pallet trucks are very useful and can often be found is in loading docks.</p>

Now, it is not a guaranteed lock that your driving experience will immensely improve after investing in a lifted truck.</p>
<p>And because body lift kits don't significantly modify the entire suspension, you're left with a high center of gravity and poor ways of dealing with death wobble. OSHA defines powered industrial trucks (PITs) as any mobile power-propelled vehicle that is used to carry, push, pull, lift, stack, or tier materials, and that can be ridden or controlled by a walking operator (see Forklift Classification Explained,” below).</p>
