Contact BigRentz at (888) 325-5172 to find the right rough terrain forklift for your job site.</p>
<p>The low step-in height, easy trailer connection and simple battery change make these trucks very user-friendly.

The Universal Stance Reach-Fork Truck allows the operator to look comfortably straight up while storing and retrieving loads.</p>
