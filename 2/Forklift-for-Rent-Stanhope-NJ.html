<p>Debating whether to rent versus buy a forklift or other material handling equipment? Pallet jacks come in a several types , including manual kinds, as well as electric-powered units, but the basic design is always the same: Two forks are positioned horizontal to the floor, allowing the operator to slide the jack under a pallet. Cherry Pickers are found in warehouse environments where they prepare orders for shipment using the cherry picker machine.</p>
<p>Telehandlers are four-wheel drive trucks with long attachments with forks in the end for lifting pallets and other equipment. Our range of second hand order pickers make for faster, more accurate order picking.

Whether you are a grocer challenged by better space utilization, a pharmaceutical distribution center dominated by narrow aisles or even a paper warehouse managing multiple sized pallet loads, NWLT has the right forklift to meet your exacting standards.

The Industrial Duty Pallet Jack is great for small spaces, and handles easily.

<p>For the same loadcapacity, forklifts differ in 3 main ways. This includes Forklift tyres, Spares and Pallet Jacksat competitive prices. Whether they be a factory-floor, rough terrain, or telehandler machine, forklifts often face far harder service than most farm machinery.
