<h2>Fork Truck San Diego</h2>
<p>If your company has an old forklift on its way out, get in touch. Counterbalance forklifts are one of the most popular types of powered industrial trucks used today, and the U.S. Occupational Safety & Health Administration (OSHA) requires counterbalance forklift training for any operator using this type of lift.

According to the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health ( NIOSH ), the three most common types of forklift injuries happen when: 1) A forklift rolls or overturns.
