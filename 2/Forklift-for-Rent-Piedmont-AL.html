<h2>Powered Pallet Truck Piedmont</h2>
<p>High-level order pickers enable an operator to pick cases or items from 20 feet to 35 feet. The best way to prevent rough terrain forklift-related injury, accidents or death is by getting educated, licensed and certified in Rough Terrain Forklift Training. In addition to standard models, TVH also offers specific models such as the silent pallet truck, scissor pallet trucks, weighing pallet trucks and pallet trucks for quarter pallets and fish totes.</p>
