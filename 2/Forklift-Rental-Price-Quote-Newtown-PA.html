If you've never rented before, you might be surprised at the actual forklift rental cost and how affordable it can be.

Such vehicles activate the suspension lift while traversing road bumps and ramps to avoid damaging the front underbody of the vehicle when driving on public roads; the suspension lift is deactivated on race tracks and level roads.</p>
<p>Scissor lifts provide access for people or equipment to height-restricted areas (up to 90').
