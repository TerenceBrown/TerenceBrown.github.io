Any attachment on a forklift will reduce its nominal load rating, which is computed with a stock fork carriage and forks. Battery electric forklifts, powered by lead-acid batteries or, increasingly, lithium-ion batteries, include: cushion tire forklifts, scissor lifts, order pickers, stackers, reach trucks and pallet jacks.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items.

If your company has an accident or injury with a forklift, OSHA will investigate and request training records.
