<p>In 1958, the first four-wheel drive rough terrain forklift was introduced. Once re-rated the forklift should have a new factory authorized specification plate, to replace the original plate, installed showing the new rating for the lift.

Suspension Lifts: For Pearland drivers searching for maximum lift, either for appearance enhancement or to survive on rugged terrain, a suspension lift is ideal.</p>

Keep in mind that some trucks use struts on the front and shock absorbers on the rear.</p>
<p>Most rough terrain forklifts have ergonomic controls for easy, intuitive use. The warehouse forklift has two subtypes: the side loader and the counterbalance forklift. Since the 1960s, Caterpillar has been producing forklift trucks designed to last, and built to perform in some of the toughest and harshest environments in the world. Order picker forklifts are specially designed devices that are used to optimize the speed and ease of picking stock from both sides of a warehouse aisle.</p>
<p>In trucks where the operator is seated, a vertical clearance of at least 39 inches should be maintained from the point of maximum depression of the seat under the operator to the underside of the section of the guard under which the operator's head moves during normal operation. Trucks with suspension lifts tend to handle quite a bit different than factory models, not only due to the higher center of gravity but also because of the changes to the suspension.</p>
