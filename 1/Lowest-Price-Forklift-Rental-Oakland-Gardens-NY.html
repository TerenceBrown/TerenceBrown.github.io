<h3>How A Crown Pallet Jack Can Benefit Your Business Oakland Gardens NY 11364</h3>
<p>When you have a pallet jack at your warehouse to help employees tackle tasks that are physically challenging, you avoid this dissatisfaction, which can affect productivity. Reach trucks are used in large warehouses that store pallets several rows high on shelving or have deep shelves that can hold multiple pallets. The increased ground clearance reduces the risk of you damaging the underbelly of your vehicle.</p>
<p>The second type of lift kit is the suspension lift kit. The average pallet jack can lift about 5,000 pounds (2,268 kg). It is important to note; however, that electric forklifts have a limited run cycle, usually 4 - 6 hours and are less capable of lifting loads greater than 15,000 pounds. As with mid-level order pickers, high-level order pickers also have a load capacity of 3,000 pounds.</p>
