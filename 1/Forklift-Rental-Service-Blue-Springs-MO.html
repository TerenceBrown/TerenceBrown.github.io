<p>Driving such a mess would be grounds for ridicule and a reminder that the driver is a low-class yokel redneck from the uncultured fly-over states.

<p>A standard warehouse forklift measures between four and seven feet wide and eight to ten feet long.

Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions. When you find forklifts that interest you, test and inspect the forklift in person at the auction.</p>
