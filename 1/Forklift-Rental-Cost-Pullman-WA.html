We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs.

<p>Like the LHM230P, the BT Pro Lifter, LHT100 is designed to work with minimal starting force for increased productivity during horizontal transport and loading operations. However, reach trucks are not really designed for outdoor use. The heavy-duty models that can lift big loads have an even larger fork shaft and double wheels at the front. Powered pallet jacks, 4 also known as electric pallet trucks, walkies, single or double pallet jacks, or power jack, are motorized to allow lifting and moving of heavier and stacked pallets.</p>
<p>Pallet jacks can be used to move pallets of new merchandise to the proper section where the merchandise needs to be put on display. Capacity requirements can arise without notice, so a forklift rental can help an operation stay nimble and responsive to changing business conditions. When you find forklifts that interest you, test and inspect the forklift in person at the auction.</p>
