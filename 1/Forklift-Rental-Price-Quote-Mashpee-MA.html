A conveyor, overhead hoist, or equivalent material handling equipment shall be provided for handling batteries.

<h2>Used Fork Lift Trucks Mashpee </h2>
<p>A forklift is a type of material handling lift that has two prongs attached to the front of it. These prongs look like a tuning fork and assist in the lifting of objects.
