Granite industrial carries an inventory full of used Baker and Linde forklift truck parts. Most order picker forklifts have a 4-point suspension mechanism between the rear tires and the front wheels.

<p>While most standard forklifts can reach between 10 and 15 feet, a telehandler can lift to heights of 55 feet.
