<h2>Travelling Heavy Loads Using Diesel Forklifts Napoleon </h2>
<p>Up one spot to No. 13, Ireland-based Combilift, makers of four-directional forklifts, side-loading equipment and straddle carriers, grew 7% after selling 4,350 units in 2016, an 11.5% increase from the previous year.

<p>Also, the higher you go with a twist, the less down travel you will have, causing quirky handling, such as skipping across the road imperfections, rather that soaking them up. On 4x4 vehicles, this also causes an issue because you could over-extend a CV axle joint on a truck that has excessive compression, but limited droop. They handle different sizes of loads and are engineered to perfection.</p>
