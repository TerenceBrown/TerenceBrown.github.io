A forklift truck is designed with protected cab for a driver and two prongs on the front to move and carry heavy loads around your factory or warehouse. The reason that these trucks are ideally suited for off road driving is that the body of the truck is protected by the fact that it's several feet away from the ground, meaning that it's less likely to come into collision with the ground or other objects on the ground.</p>
