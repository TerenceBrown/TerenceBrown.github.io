<p>Equipment Solutions for Your Short and Long-term Rental Needs. Lifted trucks have ample appeal—they provide an elevated line of sight, greater ground clearance and, most importantly, that head-turning, rugged coolness factor so many of us envy. Ideal for narrow aisles the side stance truck has the forks located on the side of the cab affording excellent visibility for the operator and minimizing maneuvering. CLARK Material Handling Company is so proud of this patent that they even sell t-shirts with pictures of the patent claim.</p>
<p>This allows it to lift small loads into tight spaces. This allows for completion of work at heights that normal forklifts cannot reach. Generally, a lifted truck has the main frame and chassis raised up one or more feet above where it would normally sit on top of the tires. Be sure to find out what kind of warranty exists on the forklift. In addition to a control to raise and lower the forks (also known as blades or tines), the operator can tilt the mast to compensate for a load's tendency to angle the blades toward the ground and risk slipping off the forks.</p>
