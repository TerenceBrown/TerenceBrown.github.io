Yet, another place where pallet trucks can be useful that is often overlooked is in a retail work environment.</p>

It happens because the one side of the chain is fixed to the immovable frame of the forklift, and the only way by which masts can move upward is when gears rotate in clockwise direction and pull the forks overhead. Raising your truck can help making towing easier, as the increased ground clearance makes loading and unloading more accessible.</p>

Class I vehicles include three-wheel electric sit-down trucks; and high- and low-platform sit-down rider type trucks with cushion tires or pneumatic tires. 123Forklift makes it easy to compare forklift prices, service plans and warranties on all used forklifts.</p>
