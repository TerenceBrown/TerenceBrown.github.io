Ask potential suppliers what their fleet size is relative to the types of equipment that you will be renting. At Solution MHE, we also have a dedicated engineering team, so if you ever experience any technical issues with your forklifts, you need only give us a call. That piece of equipment is known as the pallet jack It is possibly one of the most versatile, durable and useful pieces of material handling equipment available.</p>
<p>That's why our focus is making the forklift rental process quick and easy, without the usual red tape and fine print of the big rental companies. The 37-inch-wide C-G chassis—about five to six inches narrower than the chassis of a typical 4,000 to 7,000 lb. forklift—allows C-G Series forklifts to navigate tight rack storage aisles. Our stores in Sacramento, CA and throughout northern central California are fully equipped to meet your demands for rental forklifts.</p>
<h2>Hydraulic Hand Pallet Tucks Concord </h2>
<p>Our renowned build quality, coupled with safety innovations such as the ‘Presence Detection System' (PDS and PDS+), gives our counterbalance forklift trucks a competitive edge; helping you to improve your operational efficiency. High-Lift Platform Trucks — The maximum weight, expressed in pounds, at a specified load center that a truck can transport and stack to a height established by the manufacturer.</p>
<p>If the operator must frequently enter and exit the forklift to access product, build pallets, etc. Ask what kind of lift it is, who installed it and if there have been any problems with it. Most lifted trucks are bought used so bring along a flash light and inspect the truck for crusted mud in the vehicle's nooks and crannies. Stand-up forklifts (also known as stand-on and electric riders) are designed for applications where the operator must get on and off the lift truck frequently.</p>
<p>Transmissions on forklifts, in particular, can be subject to abuse. When not used for picking, these trucks can also be used for the transport or stacking of pallets. With lift capacities of 5,000, 6,000 and 8,000 pounds, respectively, the three established G Series rough-terrain forklift models offered by Case can be equipped with two mast heights — 15 and 22 feet — to cover most applications.</p>

<p>Towing: It's easier to tow heavier loads with a lifted truck since your truck won't be as at high of risk of bottoming out. If you are driving a forklift for the first time, one crucial thing to remember is that forklifts are steered by the rear wheels, unlike most cars. From lifting items into the shipping trucks to stocking things away in storage, their maneuverability lends well to various working environments and conditions.</p>
<p>An important aspect of forklift operation is that it must have rear-wheel steering While this increases maneuverability in tight cornering situations, it differs from a driver's traditional experience with other wheeled vehicles. They can reach heights up to 390″ Orderpickers are typically powered by 24- or 36-volt industrial batteries. Shock absorbers manage the kinetic energy that travels through your Jeep's suspension and chassis as you drive to give you a bump-free ride and keep other components from wearing out too quickly.</p>
<p>If you need the best solution in material movement within your factory premises then a pallet truck will assist you well. Order picker trucks are types of lift trucks that are controlled from a carriage wherein the operator stance can be found. They offer complete repair and maintenance services across most equipment makes and models. Some people will lift their trucks just for show, and that's cool if you do, we don't judge you.</p>

We have both weekly and monthly forklift rentals available that are structured around our clients' specific needs. Used in different warehouses and go-downs, the offered pallet truck is known for its excellent load carrying capacity. While Sit-down riders provide operator comfort, stand up trucks are better suited to applications where operators are getting on and off the trucks many times an hour.</p>
<p>But where a straight mast forklift really differs is in the maneuverability and accessibility it provides through large heavy-duty pneumatic cushion tires that enable the lift to traverse rough terrain as easily as any other equipment on the job site. Our nationwide used forklift sales network brings refurbished lifts to companies and agencies at reasonable prices.</p>
