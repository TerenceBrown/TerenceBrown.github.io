Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. Suspension lifts can enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>A subtype of the warehouse forklift, side loaders are usually found in steel service centers and manufacturing facilities with heavy and bulky items. Ensure that loads on pallets are stable, neat, cross-tied if possible, and evenly distributed. A reach truck looks like a very small type of counterbalance forklift. Lifted cars have the potential to run right over smaller vehicles in the event of a high-speed accident.</p>

Size for size, diesel forklifts that are intended for outdoor use are generally the most powerful.

In this guide, we'll show you how to choose the correct shocks for a truck equipped with a lift kit.</p>
