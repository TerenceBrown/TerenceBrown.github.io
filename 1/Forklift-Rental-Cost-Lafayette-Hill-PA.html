Pallet trucks are the efficient and simple mode of transporting palletized loads on the shop floor. Suspension lifts can enable steeper approach, departure, and breakover angles, higher ground clearance, and helps accommodate larger wheels and tires.</p>
<p>The global Pallet Trucks market is anticipated to represent a huge incremental opportunity between 2018 and 2028. This is achieved by two outer legs which distribute the load weight and prevent the forklift from tipping. This type of lift is more expensive than a body lift and requires making changes to the mechanical system or suspension of the truck. The walkie stacker has a subtype: the order picker forklift.</p>
<p>Well, one of the simplest ways to make a truck stand out is integrating a body lift kit or suspension lift kit. You can rent top-quality and expertly-maintained equipment at United Rentals. These are classifications of six commonly-used types of forklifts, as recognized by OSHA, along with different types of trucks unique to each class. We stand behind all of the forklifts we rent to our clients, ensuring that each piece of machinery not only achieves peak performance, but also adheres to stringent California emissions requirements.</p>

Conveniently mounted on the cowl, the hydraulic control levers allow the operator to gain access from the right or left side of the truck.
