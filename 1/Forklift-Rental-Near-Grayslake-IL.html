While it's true that safety officials (OSHA) are more likely to inspect large commercial jobsites than residential or multifamily ones, they will visit any site where incidents have occurred or where complaints have been made. The Class I, Class II, and Class IV have a moderated growth rate over the forecast period as end-users are largely adopting Class III and Class V Forklift Trucks for the various applications.</p>

Inquire about specific used forklifts that are in your price range and meet your requirements.
