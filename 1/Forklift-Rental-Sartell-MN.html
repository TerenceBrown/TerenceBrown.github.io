<p>As well as Materials Handling equipment - covering London, Heathrow, Gatwick and surrounding areas. The thrill of navigating rough and rocky terrain can only be accomplished in a truck that has the right amount of ground clearance and larger tires. These types of forklifts are all hand controlled where the operator is in the front of the truck and controls the lift truck through a steering tiller.</p>
<p>At our GMC dealership near Rocky Mount and Goldsboro in Wilson, we offer professional upgraded lifted GMC trucks. Forklifts use rear wheel steering. My "beater" 4WD has a 3" lift kit that gives it about a 10" minimum ground clearance-more than enough clearance to handle some quite nasty trails-but I actually use my 4WD for both work and pleasure in areas where such capability is a necessity.</p>
