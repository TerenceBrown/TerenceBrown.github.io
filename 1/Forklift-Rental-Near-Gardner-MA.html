<p>Studies have shown that there are roughly 900,000 Rough Terrain Forklifts used every day in U.S. businesses. Citizens are free to install lift kits and after-market wheels, as well as grill guards, performance shocks, and after-market bumpers. The Industrial Truck Association (ITA, ) has defined seven classes of lift trucks, or forklifts, which are defined by the type of engine, work environment, operator position and equipment characteristics. In some cases, you may be looking to expand your business or take on work that requires equipment you don't have, like a forklift.</p>

Designed for both indoor and outdoor applications, electric and internal combustion engine tractors have weight capacities of between 3,000 lbs.

The next huge advance in the forklift industry involved the electric engine. Our annual look at the largest global manufacturers of lift trucks ranked by revenue. Skids were the first pallets ever produced, appearing in American factories along with low-lift trucks in the late 1880s.</p>
<p>As long as the needs of your business fit the abilities and the strengths of the forklift, both the electric forklift and electric reach stacker can be extremely beneficial to your company. Suspension Lift Kit: If money's not an object and you want to go all out for a kit that lifts both your body and suspension for maximum off-road capabilities, a suspension lift kit is the way to go.</p>

Multi directional internal combustion forklifts are designed to handle palletized loads and long awkward loads up to 50,000lbs with ease.

Extreme Weather: Since rough terrain forklifts come equipped with high-traction tires, they can tackle all kinds of weather conditions. The Apex features a 6 inch off road suspension, custom wheels, and all-terrain tires.</p>
<p>Drive the forklift forwards and backwards and in a figure eight pattern, stopping and starting in order to test the responsiveness of steering and braking. They are smaller than most forklifts and so are able to manoeuvre in those hard-to-reach areas. Forget parking garages, and height clearance could become an issue in some drive thrus. With breakthrough lift heights, capacities, visibility and energy savings, the Crown family of reach trucks can help you move and store materials efficiently.</p>
<p>Forklift operators can lift up and lower the forks, use side shifters to move loads and tilt the mast so the load doesn't slide off the forks. The multidirectional BT Reflex F-series of reach trucks offer AC power, clear-view masts, 360Â° steering and sideways battery exchange for increased productivity and manoeuvrability. Aimed at a prosperous growth in this domain, we are engaged in offering an excellent quality range of Hydraulic Hand Pallet Truck.</p>
